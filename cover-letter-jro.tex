    Dear Dr.\ So and Members of the Search Committee:

% \raggedright
Please consider my application for an Assistant Professorship in
\highlight{
Job Title.
}
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at Auburn
University.
I am excited about this opportunity because of the wealth of potential
colleagues and resources in your department.
% Your strong commitment to both research and research-based undergraduate
% education is a perfect fit for my career aspirations.
% \highlight{
% Furthermore, my wife and I would love to stay and raise our daughter in the
% Puget Sound Area.
% }

I am a broadly trained
% biologist
computational biologist
who studies the evolutionary genetics of
natural populations.
In my research program, I use genomic variation within and among species to
investigate the processes that generate biodiversity and promote and constrain
adaptation.
The research in my lab is quantitative and integrative, incorporating concepts
and techniques from
phylogenetics,
population genetics,
genomics,
% bioinformatics,
statistics,
and 
computer science.

My qualifications for this faculty position include successful acquisition
of funding for my research program.
During my academic career, I have secured more than
% \$1,161,712
\$1.15 million
in grants and fellowships from such funding sources as the 
National Science Foundation,
Endangered Species Conservation Fund,
National Research Council,
and
National Geographic Society.
With this support, I have
% (1) conducted extensive international fieldwork that resulted in
% the deposition of valuable specimens and genetic materials in multiple
% museums around the world,
% (2) published 14 peer-reviewed papers, and
% (3) developed a number of computational and bioinformatics tools.
published 22 peer-reviewed papers and
developed a number of
% computational and bioinformatics tools.
\href{http://phyletica.org/software/}{computational tools}.
% To date, my research has resulted in 13 peer-reviewed publications,
% including five first-authored publications.
% \emph{Evolution},
% \emph{BMC Evolutionary Biology},
% \href{http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01373.x/abstract}{\it
% Evolution}, one of which was featured on the journal's cover and in
% \href{http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v474/n7353/full/474545a.html}{\it
% Nature}. 

% I have a strong background in computational biology and bioinformatics.
% Early in my graduate career, I realized that too often scientific questions and
% projects are framed around available methods and software.
% As a result, I have sought to mitigate this constraint by acquiring the
% necessary computational and mathematical skills to be able to develop and
% implement the most appropriate statistical methods for addressing my biological
% questions of interest.
% I am comfortable programming in several different languages, and have spent the
% last five years as a developer of several
% \href{http://www.phyletica.com/?page_id=249}{open-source software packages}.
% \href{http://phylo.bio.ku.edu/software/sate/sate.html}{{SAT}\'{e}}.
% Furthermore, I write and maintain several other open-source software
% \href{https://github.com/joaks1?tab=repositories}{packages and tools}.

I am strongly committed to teaching and mentoring
\highlight{
    undergraduate
}
students.
Through my experiences as a tutor, teaching assistant, workshop instructor,
professor, and prison educator, 
I have developed a strong passion for teaching science to a broad diversity of
students.
% I recently received an Award for Excellence in Teaching from the
% University of Kansas Division of Biological Sciences for teaching the
% discussion sections of an undergraduate genetics course.
% As a graduate student, I received an Award for Excellence in Teaching from the
% University of Kansas (KU) Division of Biological Sciences, and I mentored local
% high school students, KU undergraduates, and international undergraduate and
% graduate students in the methods of field-based biodiversity research.
While at AU, I have developed three graduate and two
undergraduate courses,
helped develop a
curriculum for our graduate students to earn a
\href{http://bulletin.auburn.edu/thegraduateschool/graduatedegreesoffered/biologicalsciencesmsphd_major/computationalbiology_gradcert/}{
    certificate in computational biology},
and taught modules for our annual 
\href{http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/bioinformatics/}{Bioinformatics Bootcamp}.
As part of Alabama Prison Education + Arts Project,
I have developed and taught evolutionary biology courses to students incarcerated in state correctional facilities.
As part of my NSF postdoctoral fellowship, I
worked with the UW
\href{https://sites.google.com/site/uwbioedresgroup/home}{Biology Education
    Research Group} to develop
inquiry-based teaching activities, assess their effectiveness
by measuring student learning, and lead an active-learning classroom in
\href{http://courses.biology.washington.edu/biol180/}{Introductory Biology}.
% \highlight{
%     under the mentorship of Dr.\ Scott Freeman.
% }
% Taking an evidence-based, high-engagement approach to the classroom has
% prepared me to be an effective teacher in academia.
All of these experiences have prepared me to be an effective teacher in
academia and beyond.

The most rewarding part of my role as a PI is mentoring the personnel in my lab
group.
I have been fortunate in recruiting a large, diverse group of talented
students and postocs to my lab.
In three years at AU, I have had six Ph.D.\ and two M.Sc.\ students;
the latter have graduated and are now in Ph.D.\ programs, one of which
was awarded an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
Currently, I have one NSF-funded postdoc in my lab.
Of the two previous postdocs in my lab, one is now an Assistant Professor and
the other is in his second postdoc position.
I have had 10 undergraduate researchers, including four NSF-funded
REU students.
Three of these students are still working in the lab,
and two have moved on to graduate programs.


% I am also qualified for the curatorial aspect of the position.
% For two years, I was the Curatorial Assistant for the Herpetology
% collection at the University of Kansas, one of the largest collections of
% amphibians and reptiles in the United States.
% In the absence of a Collection Manager, I was responsible for all aspects
% of managing the collection, including accessions, cataloging, database
% management, loans, import/export permits, and general collection and wet
% lab upkeep.
% I made several improvements to the collection database that greatly
% increased the efficiency and accuracy of digitizing new data and
% processing of loans.

% Under my mentorship, Liz Lusher, a KU undergraduate, secured an Undergraduate
% Research Award and successfully completed a phylogeographic study of ringneck
% snakes across the Great Plains.


% My research program is geographically focused in Central and Southeast Asia,
% creating many international research opportunities for students.
% Furthermore, I will leverage my international collaborations to recruit
% talented young students to join my lab from countries such as Malaysia,
% Thailand, and Mongolia.
% Being a first-generation college graduate, I understand what a tremendous
% opportunity a world-class higher education can provide for underprivileged
% students.
% \highlight{
%     Local research\ldots
% I am also interested in developing projects locally in the Pacific Northwest;
% the diversity of habitats across this region provide an excellent opportunity
% for establishing a comparative research program investigating the
% diversification of the region's rich biota.
% I am also interested in developing projects locally along the Pacific Coast;
% the diversity of habitats across California and offshore islands provide an
% excellent opportunity for establishing a comparative research program
% investigating biodiversification across the region.
% I am also interested in developing projects locally in the Upper Midwest; the
% diversity of habitats and juxtaposition of glaciated and unglaciated zones
% provides an excellent opportunity for establishing a comparative research
% program investigating biodiversification across the region.
% I am also interested in developing projects locally along the Atlantic Coast;
% the diversity of habitats across this region provide an excellent opportunity
% for establishing a comparative research program investigating the
% diversification of the region's rich biota.
% }
% Such work would create many local projects for undergraduate students to
% complement international opportunities.
% I would love the opportunity to foster and grow the herpetology collection
% in your department through active, collections-based research both locally
% and internationally.


As a faculty member, I strive to be a well-funded, productive researcher,
collaborative colleague, passionate teacher, and supportive advisor.
My diverse and integrative research interests, as well as my commitment to
teaching and mentoring, would be an asset to the
\highlight{
Biology Department
at
the University of Jobs.
