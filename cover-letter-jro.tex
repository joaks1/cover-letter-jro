\opening{Dear Members of the Search Committee:}
% \raggedright
Please consider my application for an Assistant Professorship in
Evolutionary Biology.
I am excited about this opportunity because of the wealth of potential
colleagues and resources in your department.
I am currently an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow working with Drs.\ Adam
Leach\'{e} and Vladimir Minin in the Departments of Biology and
Statistics, respectively, at the University of Washington.

I am a broadly trained biologist who studies the evolutionary genetics of
natural populations.
My research program uses genomic variation within and among species to
investigate the processes that generate biodiversity and promote and
constrain adaptation.
My research is quantitative and integrative, incorporating concepts and
techniques from phylogenetics, population genetics, genomics,
bioinformatics, statistics, and computer science.

While my research program is geographically focused in the Old World, I am
keenly interested in developing projects locally in the South Central
United States.
The diversity of habitats across Oklahoma provide an excellent opportunity
for developing a comparative research program investigating the
phylogeography of the region.
Such work would create many local projects for undergraduate and graduate
students.
I would love the opportunity to foster and grow the Herpetology Collection
in your department through active, collections-based research both locally
and internationally.

My qualifications for this faculty position include successful acquisition
of funding for my research program.
During my graduate and postdoctoral career, I have secured more than
\$400,000 in fellowships and grants from such funding sources as the 
National Science Foundation,
National Research Council,
National Geographic Society,
Society of Systematic Biologists, and
Sigma Xi Scientific Research Society.
To date, my research has resulted in 13 peer-reviewed publications,
including five first-authored publications.
% \emph{Evolution},
% \emph{BMC Evolutionary Biology},
% \href{http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01373.x/abstract}{\it
% Evolution}, one of which was featured on the journal's cover and in
% \href{http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v474/n7353/full/474545a.html}{\it
% Nature}. 

I am also qualified for the curatorial aspect of the position.
For two years, I was the Curatorial Assistant for the Herpetology
collection at the University of Kansas, one of the largest collections of
amphibians and reptiles in the United States.
In the absence of a Collection Manager, I was responsible for all aspects
of managing the collection, including accessions, cataloging, database
management, loans, import/export permits, and general collection and wet
lab upkeep.
I made several improvements to the collection database that greatly
increased the efficiency and accuracy of digitizing new data and
processing of loans.

I am strongly committed to teaching and mentoring undergraduate and
graduate students.
Through my experiences as a tutor, teaching assistant, workshop instructor
and lecturer, I have developed a strong passion for teaching science.
I recently received an Award for Excellence in Teaching from the
University of Kansas Division of Biological Sciences for teaching the
discussion sections of an undergraduate genetics course.
As a graduate student, I received an Award for Excellence in Teaching from
the University of Kansas Division of Biological Sciences for teaching
Genetics, and I mentored local high school students, KU undergraduates,
and both undergraduate and graduate students in Malaysia in the methods of
field-based biodiversity research.
As part of my postdoctoral fellowship, I am currently developing and
implementing active-learning teaching activities, assessing student
learning, and lecturing Introductory Biology at the University of
Washington under the mentorship of Dr. Scott Freeman, a leader in the
science of biology education.
% Under my mentorship, Liz Lusher, a KU undergraduate, secured an Undergraduate
% Research Award and successfully completed a phylogeographic study of ringneck
% snakes across the Great Plains.

I also have a strong background in Computational Biology.
Early in my research career, I realized that too often scientific
questions and projects are framed around available methods and software.
As a result, I have sought to mitigate this constraint by acquiring the
necessary computational and mathematical skills to be able to develop and
implement the most appropriate method for addressing my biological
question of interest when it does not exist.
I am comfortable programming in several different languages, and have
spent the last five years as a developer of several open-source software
packages.
% \href{http://phylo.bio.ku.edu/software/sate/sate.html}{{SAT}\'{e}}.
% Furthermore, I write and maintain several other open-source software
% \href{https://github.com/joaks1?tab=repositories}{packages and tools}.


As a faculty member, I will strive to be a well-funded, productive
researcher, collaborative colleague, passionate teacher, and supportive
advisor.
My diverse and integrative research interests, as well as my commitment to
teaching and mentoring, would be an asset to the Department of Zoology at
the Oklahoma State University.
%After reviewing my application materials, I hope you will strongly consider me
%for the position.

I have requested letters of support from Drs.\
Mark Holder
(\href{mailto:mtholder@ku.edu}{\tt mtholder@ku.edu}),
Adam Leach\'{e}
(\href{mailto:leache@uw.edu}{\tt leache@uw.edu}),
and
Cameron Siler
(\href{mailto:camsiler@ou.edu}{\tt camsiler@ou.edu}),
% transcripts from the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh, Louisiana State
% University, and the University of Kansas.
Upon request, I am happy to provide a copy of my manuscripts that are
currently in review or in press.
Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to speaking
with you about this position.
% Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
