\opening{Dear Editor:}
\raggedright
I am submitting a manuscript entitled ``Evidence for climate-driven diversification? A caution for interpreting ABC inferences of simultaneous historical events'' to be considered for publication in the International Journal of Organic Evolution.
The field of research is comparative biogeography and approximate Bayesian model selection.
We will make all of the computer scripts, DNA sequences, and sequence alignments used in this study freely available on github ((\url{https://github.com/}), Dryad (\url{http://datadryad.org/}), and GenBank (\url{http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/}), respectively.

In this paper, we demonstrate low power and bias in a widely used approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) method of model selection.
The ABC method, msBayes, uses a hierarchical comparative model to infer the distribution of divergence times among co-distributed pairs of populations.
Phylogeographers use this method to test whether certain historical biogeographical events caused diversification across multiple groups of organisms.
Researchers have often found support for models in which co-distributed pairs of taxa diverged simultaneously, which has been interpreted as evidence for a shared historical divergence event.

We use msBayes to test a prediction of the paradigm of Pleistocene-climate-driven diversification in the Philippines.
Like many previous users of the method, we find strong support for 22 population pairs diverging recently and simultaneously.
Instead of interpreting this result as validating predictions of the hypothesis of climate-driven diversification, we use extensive simulation-based power analyses to determine what support for ``simultaneous'' divergence really means in the context of ABC model selection.
The results of our power analyses demonstrate that we were likely to infer a model of simultaneous divergence even if the divergence times of the 22 population pairs were randomly distributed over the past 2.5 million years.
Thus, by focusing on a phylogeographic scale, researchers are biased towards infer the biologically interesting model of simultaneous divergence.

We feel our paper will serve as an important caution for interpreting previous results of ABC model-selection procedures, and will help guide future work in developing and applying such methods.
In the paper, we discuss several possible causes for the bias we revealed, as well as avenues to explore for mitigating the bias.

The following scientists would be appropriate reviewers of the manuscript:
